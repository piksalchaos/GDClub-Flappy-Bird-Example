These are my personal notes for designing the workshop!

day 1:
creating the bird
	bird starts paused
	once you click, the main scene will activate the bird
	when the bird is activated:
		it can flap
		whenever it flaps, it emits the flap audio
		it falls by gravity
		it's rotation responds to its y velocity

variables
constants
data types and typed variables
	float
	bool
	vector2
	node types (audiostreamplayer and inputevent, which doesn't rly matter)
properties (position)
virtual functions (_ready, _physics_process, and _input)
custom functions (activate() in the player scene and begin_game() in the main scene)
calling functions
accessing properties and methods using '.' operator
accessing child nodes using '$'
'@onready' annotation
how to use delta_time
conditional statements
conditional operators (not, <)
the weird fact that the y axis is inverted in godot
doing math in code (+= sign, '*' for multiplication)
using "return" to end a function

day 2:
creating the pipe scene
instantiating pipes in the main scene when the game begins
	pipes spawn in by a timer
	each pipe has a random y position
using a for loop to move the pipes left and removing them when they move out of the screen
whenever the player goes in between the pipes, they will score a point by signal in pipe scene
	this will also trigger the score audio

arrays
for loops
for loops with range()
godot timers
godot scene instancing
signals (_on_pipe_timer_timeout)
custom signals ('scored' in pipe scene) and connecting them in code
using "print" to debug

day 3:
killing the player whenever it hits the pipe
	pipe will emit a hit signal whenever a body enters it
killing the player whenever it touches the ground
	its an area2d on the floor that triggers the hit function whenever a body enters it
when the player dies, it's is_flying property becomes false, and game ends
	it just falls to the floor rotated 90 degrees
	hit audio will play when game ends
new variable game_ended in main_scene that becomes true when player dies. when its true:
	the pipes will stop spawning and moving
	the restart button will show itself
when you press the restart button, the current scene will reload itself
changing the z index of the player and gui so it shows up in front of the pipes
